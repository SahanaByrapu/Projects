At present scenario, many apps are being developed which provides best way to search for and discover great places to eat at or order .Consider, “Zomato ” as an example, which is easy-to-use social restaurant finder app that lets us to explore all dining options in the city.
But, these sort of apps are confined to opulent restaurants which are not quite affordable to wide range of people especially college students. On top of that, these foodie bays are geographically far away to the people who stay in remote areas and there is less chance of probability of being nearer to colleges and thus leads to lot of overhead in travelling due to traffic in most of the cases.
