EXISTING SYSTEM
In this contemporary situation, many applications are providing a best way to find the foodie bays which enables the users to eat at (or) order online. In this context, we can quote “Zomato” as an example which is easy-to-use social restaurant finder app that lets us to explore all dining options in the city.
However, these kinds of applications are restricted to affluent restaurants which are not quite suitable to abundant set of people especially college goers.
On top of that, these substantial eateries may be located at the heart of the city which leads to trouble for the people who live in distant places.

With the help of this strategy, the hotels located in deserted and remote areas comes into limelight and thus results in decline of strength of population going to opulent restaurants and encourages local vendors to set and grow their business.
